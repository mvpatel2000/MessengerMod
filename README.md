# MessengerMod
Website: messenger-mod.herokuapp.com

A simple website that allows for a user to select any color instead of the 15 ones allowed by facebook in facebook messenger. All it requires is login information, the chat name, and the new html color code. This is done using the facebook-chat-api, a node.js backend server, and a simple html form with bootstrap.
